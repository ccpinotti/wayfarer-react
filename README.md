The goal of this project is to develop a travel community for users to share city-specific tips ("posts") about their favorite locations around the world.

This repository and React app provides the client side for our project, including city view and CRUDability of user posts.

## Technologies Used

- React

## Existing Features
- View the "San Francisco" page including the site-wide header, the name of the city, and an iconic photo of the city.
- View a list of posts on the San Francisco page sorted by newest first, with the post titles linked to the individual post "show" pages.
- Use an "Add New Post" button on the San Francisco city page to pull up the new post form.
- Create a new post for San Francisco.
- Click "Edit" on ANY individual post, and be redirected to the edit form.
- Click "delete" on ANY individual post, then see a pop-up that says: "Are you sure you want to delete #{title}?" If the user confirms, delete the post.
